  * golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20220314234659-1baeb1ce4c0b
  * golang.org/x/sys@v0.0.0-20220412211240-33da011f77ad
  * golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20211209124913-491a49abca63
  * golang.org/x/text@v0.3.7

## 0.2.1 (December 15, 2020)

BUG FIXES:

  * Update ssh-helper's `Version` to properly reflect its release version

## 0.2.0 (August 19, 2020)

SECURITY:

- HashiCorp vault-ssh-helper up to and including version 0.1.6 incorrectly accepted Vault-issued 
  SSH OTPs for the subnet in which a host's network interface was located, rather than the specific IP address 
  assigned to that interface. Assigned CVE-2020-24359, fixed in 0.2.0.

## 0.1.6 (June 26, 2020)

FEATURES:

  * Add support for namespaces [GH-44](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-ssh-helper/pull/44)


## 0.1.4 (November 8 2017)

SECURITY:

  * Make a safe exit when displaying usage text [GH-32]

## 0.1.3 (February 8 2017)

SECURITY:

  * Verify that OTPs conform to UUID format [7a831a5]

## 0.1.2 (August 24 2016)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Added `allowed_roles` option to configuration, which enforces specified
    role names to be present in the verification response received by the agent.

UPGRADE NOTES:

  * The option `allowed_roles` is a breaking change. When vault-ssh-helper
    is upgraded, it is required that the existing configuration files have
    an entry for `allowed_roles="*"` to be backwards compatible.

## 0.1.1 (February 25 2016)

SECURITY:

  * Introduced `dev` mode. If `dev` mode is not activated, `vault-ssh-helper`
    can only communicate with Vault that has TLS enabled [f7a8707]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Updated the documentation [GH-12]

BUG FIXES:

  * Empty check for `allowed_cidr_list` [9acaa58]

## 0.1.0 (December 2 2015)

  * Initial release
